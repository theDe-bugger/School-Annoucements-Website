# School-Annoucements-Website
I created this notifications website as a school project to allow teachers to post announcements which students can later see.

Begin with the hub HTML file, and open two tabs. One for the teacher input and one for the student input
Once you input the information in the teacher input page and post the announcement, you can input student information and click go to announcements page to view the announcements applicable to the student.
